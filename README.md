in the healthcare sector, sentiment analysis on drug reviews is crucial for understanding patient experiences and improving medications. Sentiment analysis, a natural language processing technique, assesses the polarity of text data from sources like social media and reviews. Common models include BOW, TF-IDF, Naive Bayes, and SVM. Deep learning models like CNN, RNN, LSTM, and transformers like BERT, enhance accuracy by capturing context and sequential dependencies. Pharmaceutical companies use these insights to refine drugs and treatments, ultimately enhancing patient care and satisfaction. This repository explores various sentiment analysis models and their applications in healthcare.
